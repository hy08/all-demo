## Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?

(If this is a _usage question_, please **do not post it here**—post it on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/redux) instead. If this is not a “feature” or a “bug”, or the phrase “How do I...?” applies, then it's probably a usage question.)
